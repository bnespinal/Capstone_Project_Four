Description/Purpose: For this project, I have created a fake game forum site. With this project, I have worked different areas of 
functionality. There are some pages and functions that users must register with the site to be able to see and use. This project 
also uses data tables created in phpmyadmin. Among its functionality, users are able to register as a member of this made up forum 
and log into the site where they will have access to additional pages and functions only logged in users can see. There are three games that the forum is automatically dedicated to, and then you can add a game if you wish to bring it up.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server which hosts this 
webpage.

Usage: This project can be used to view a game forum webpage and use some of its functionalities, which includes registering 
as a user, and writing posts, searching for users and forums, viewing/updating user information, viewing all blogs at once, and adding in games that are not already dedicated to the site. Also, there is email verification.

Future Work: For future work, I would like to be work more with the email verification so that messages received do not say Apache
as the sender. Also, I would like to input an a function that allows users to upload photos to their feed, and to their profile. I would also like to add in a live search function, so you do not have to go back to the search page every time you want to make another search. I would also like to work more on front end appearance.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Graphic Design. One field that employees
in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
